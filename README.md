# COMP2870 Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science II: Lab exercises for Linear Algebra

## How to access the lab

You can access the lab worksheet directly through [minerva](https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/) or [github](https://github.com/COMP2870-2526/linear-algebra-student-labs).

You can also use the *Noteable compute service*. To access Noteable, navigate in minerva to the correct module, select "Noteable Computational Notebooks":

This opens the Noteable interface. Choose "Standard Python 3" from the drop down list in the Green box then select start:

You can access the lab notebooks in the directory "shared-data-202526_41390_COMP2870". **Ensure that you copy the files to the directory you started from.** This copy of the files is persistent and won't be deleted at the end of your session.

The [Noteable user guide](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/user-guide/) provides more information.

These lab worksheets are written using ['Jupyter Notebooks'](https://jupyter.org/). Many, many tutorials and guides are [available online](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).
