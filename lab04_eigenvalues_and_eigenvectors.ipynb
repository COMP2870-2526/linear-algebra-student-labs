    "1. **Timeliness** You should complete all of the activities in the order provided and submit your portfolio evidence on Gradescope before the completion date (Friday 21 November, 5pm).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Presentation** You should present all of your work clearly and concisely following additional guidance below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integrity** You are responsible for ensuring that all the evidence you submit as part of your portfolio is entirely your own work. You can find out more about Academic integrity on the Skill@library website. All work you submit for assessment is subject to the academic integrity policy.\n",

    "### Feedback\n",
    "Feedback on formative activities will be provided via lab classess and tutorials. Feedback on evidence submitted as part of the portfolio will be available on Gradescope.\n",

    "Support with the activity sheet is available in the lab classes and tutorials. Individual support is available via the online booking system.\n",

    "### Statement on the Use of Generative AI (Red Category)\n",
    "This assessment is RED according to the GenAI traffice light system. **Generative AI (GenAI) tools cannot be used**. The aim of this task is for you to develop and demonstrate the specific skills and knowledge covered in the taught sessions. We want you to independently develop your understanding, criticical thinking skills and demonstrate fundamental skills that will be required throughout your programme. Reliance on GenAI could prevent you from achieving the intended learning outcomes and may impeded your skill development.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are still permitted to use dictionaries, thesauri, spelling and grammer-checking software to help identify and correct spelling mistakes and grammatrical errors (even if they are powered by GenAI). However, you should not use any software to rewrite sentence or make substantial changes to your original text, as this would be against the rules of this category.\n",
